      <p>I was born in Peru and moved to Northern Virginia when I was 6 years old. My hobbies include rock climbing, writing, reading, and napping. I attended George Mason University where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Business Management with a minor in Economics. I worked in the staffing industry for a year before deciding that I wanted to pursue a career in web development.</p>
